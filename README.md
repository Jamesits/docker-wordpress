# About this Repo

James Swineson's WordPress variant. Suitable if you:
* use a low-end Docker public cloud service
* is migrating an old WordPress installation to Docker
* need to put the whole WordPress installation dir into a volume
* and still needs auto upgrading

Runtime:
* Apache 2
* PHP 7

Preinstalled:
* WordPress
* wp-cli
* some useful Apache modules
* some useful PHP modules

## Notes
Please mount `/var/www/html` as a volume.

## Environment Variables
* `WORDPRESS_ROOT`: the path you want to install WordPress (if not exist) to. Defaults and relative to `/var/www/html`.
* `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`, `WORDPRESS_DB_USER`, `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD`: MySQL things.
* `WORDPRESS_FIX_PERMISSION`: set to chmod everything to a correct permission. Needed if you are migrating or some directory is not able to be written by WordPress. May take >6hrs on a large site. Don't set it on every container start.
* `WORDPRESS_NO_INSTALLATION`: explicitly skip WordPress detection and auto-installation. Useful if you want a clean LAMP environment.
* `WORDPRESS_UPDATE`: set to upgrade WordPress and all plugins on container start.
* `WORDPRESS_BEHIND_REVERSE_PROXY`: Set to use Apache2's mod_remoteip to parse correct ip if behind a reverse proxy. Also set `WORDPRESS_REVERSE_PROXY_HEADER` to your reverse proxy's IP header (defaults to `X-Forwarded-Proto`) and `WORDPRESS_REVERSE_PROXY_ADDR` to your reverse proxy's IP address (or CIDR or domain).

## FAQ
### Redirect Loop behind HTTPS proxy
Add the following code to the top of `/wp-config.php` right below `<?php` tag:
```php
// enable HTTPS detection behind proxy
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);
// in some setups HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO might contain
// a comma-separated list e.g. http,https
// so check for https existence
if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'], 'https') !== false)
       $_SERVER['HTTPS']='on';
```
